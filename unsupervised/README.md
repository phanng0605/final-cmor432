# Unsupervised Learning

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key **unsupervised** machine learning techniques **using** scikit‑learn.

## Notebooks Included
- **kmeans_clustering_library.ipynb**: K‑Means clustering on a synthetic customer dataset, including Elbow method and silhouette analysis.
- **dbscan_library.ipynb**: Density‑based clustering on interleaving moons synthetic data using `DBSCAN`, with noise detection.
- **pca_library.ipynb**: Dimensionality reduction on the Wine dataset via `PCA`, visualizing principal components.
- **image_svd_compression_library.ipynb**: Image compression demonstration using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on a grayscale sample image.

## How to Run
1. From the repository root, install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
2. Launch the notebook's kernel
3. Open the unsupervised_learning/ folder, and launch any notebook.
4. Follow each notebook’s instructions to generate data, apply algorithms, and visualize results.
